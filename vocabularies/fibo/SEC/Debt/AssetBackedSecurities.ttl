	cmns-av:explanatoryNote
		"Auto asset-backed securities (auto ABS) are typically structured finance securities that are collateralized by auto loans or leases, such as those to prime (good credit standing) and subprime (poor credit standing) borrowers. Loans or leases are bundled into pools and transferred to a special-purpose entity (SPE), which, in turn, transfers the pool to a (bankruptcy remote) trust. Payments on the underlying auto loans and leases are pooled in the trust, and the funds are used to pay note investors their respective principal which, in turn, transfers the pool to a (bankruptcy remote) trust, i.e., one that protects the security from bankruptcy. Payments on the underlying auto loans and leases are pooled in the trust, and the funds are used to pay note investors their respective principal and interest when due. Any leftover funds - known as excess spread, or the net interest margin - are paid to the equity holder (usually the issuer, such as an auto finance company)."@en ,
		"If the credit risk of the pool has been decoupled from the institution via an SPV, then an auto asset-backed security is also a structured finance instrument."@en

This is a method of providing investors with a relatively predictable repayment schedule, even though the underlying assets are nonamortizing. A risk inherent in this kind of ABS is an early amortization event."

	cmns-av:explanatoryNote "In a credit card securitization transaction only the receivables are sold, not the accounts that generate the receivables. The financial institution retains legal ownership of the credit card accounts and can continue to change the terms on the accounts. Accounts corresponding to securitized loans are typically referred to as the designated accounts (or sometimes trust accounts). The initial outstanding balances on the designated accounts are sold to the trust as are the rights to any new charges on the designated accounts. Subsequently, as cardholder purchase activity generates more receivables on the designated accounts, these new receivables are purchased by the trust from the originating institution/seller/transferor. The trust uses the monthly principal payments received from the cardholders to acquire these new charges or receivables. When the securitization is initially set up, the originating institution/seller adds sufficient receivables to support the principal balance of the certificates plus an additional amount (seller's interest) that serves to absorb fluctuations in the outstanding balance of the receivables. The originating institution/seller will make subsequent additions to the trust in order to keep the seller's interest at the required level."@en ;

Similar to mortgage and other asset securitizations, the financial institution that originates the credit card receivables sells a group of these receivables to a trust. The trust then creates and sells certificates backed by the credit card receivables to investors, which are predominately institutional investors. Very few credit card ABS are marketed to retail customers, primarily due to the complex nature of the transactions and the need to continually monitor various performance indices on the underlying receivables. The underlying credit card receivables generate income to support the interest payments on the certificates."@en ;
