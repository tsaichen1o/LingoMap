fibo-fnd-dt-fd:RegularSchedule
	a owl:Class ;
	skos:example "An ISDA FpML schedule has a specified date (via a convention), and a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: (1) a schedule beginning and end; (2) a set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; (3) optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end), which may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date) Length of each regular period: Frequency (a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition to a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this." ;
	cmns-av:explanatoryNote "A parametric schedule is a regular schedule for one of the events that occur in a periodic schedule of interest accruals, interest payments, and (for floating rate swapstreams), changes to the interest rate. Parametric schedules may be specified individually but more commonly, calculation events are scheduled, with other dates specified as offsets. In a regular schedule, related dates may be independently parametrically scheduled." ;
