		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Accounting/AccountingEquity.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.""" ,

		"By stripping out the non-cash depreciation and amortization expense as well as taxes and debt costs dependent on the capital structure, EBITDA attempts to represent cash profit generated by the company's operations. EBITDA is not a metric recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Some public companies report EBITDA in their quarterly results along with adjusted EBITDA figures typically excluding additional costs, such as stock-based compensation." ,
		"EBITDA is often used as a proxy for cash flow, as it shows how much cash a company can generate from its core operations. However, EBITDA has some limitations, such as ignoring the cost of maintaining and replacing capital assets, and being susceptible to manipulation by excluding certain expenses."
