		"""This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification. It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

	* FinancialDates -- financial Dates and Schedules
	* BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
	* Occurrences -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them. Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together."""

		"Business day conventions are linked to a calendar. Calendars have working and non-working days. In the ACTUS dictionary, the rules related to business day conventions (BDCs) state that a BDC value other than N means that cash flows cannot fall on non-working days, they must be shifted to the next business day (following) or the previous on (preceding). These two simple rules get refined twofold: (1) Following modified (preceding): Same like following (preceding), however if a cash flow gets shifted into a new month, then it is shifted to preceding (following) business day; (2) Shift/calculate (SC) and calculate/shift (CS). Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round." ,
		"""Business day conventions commonly include:
- Following business day: Moves the date to the next business day
- Modified following business day: Moves the date to the next business day, unless it would fall in the next calendar month
- Preceding business day: Moves the date to the previous business day
- Modified preceding business day: Moves the date to the previous business day, unless it would fall in the previous calendar month""" ,
		"""The 2006 IDSA Definitions Section 4.11, provide the following examples: FRN Convention; Eurodollar Convention.
- If a payment date or period end date falls on a non-business day, it is moved to the next business day.
- If there is no numerically corresponding day in a calendar month, the payment date or period end date is moved to the last business day in that month."""
