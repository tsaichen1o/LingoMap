	cmns-av:explanatoryNote
		"In general parlance, loans secured by real estate are often called mortgages or mortgage loans. This usage conflates a number of related concepts, which would limit the usability of FIBO for financial institutions and regulators with respect to such loans. As described herein, many different kinds of loans can be secured by real estate, including various commercial, construction, agricultural, and consumer loans."@en ,
		"In the US, to be considered wholly or substantially secured by a lien or liens on real property, the estimated value of the real estate collateral at origination (after deducting any more senior liens held by others) must be greater than 50 percent of the principal amount of the loan at origination."@en ,
		"The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular payments divided into principal and interest. The property then serves as collateral to secure the loan."@en
