	dcterms:abstract """A loan or series of loans made for the purposes of study at some institution of learning.
		This ontology and much of the common supporting information on loan applications are based on extensive review and input from Sallie Mae in the US and there may be other variants of student loans that are not covered here. For example in principle a student loan may be framed as a credit facility in some arrangements and as a single loan with separate payment phases in others.""" ;
