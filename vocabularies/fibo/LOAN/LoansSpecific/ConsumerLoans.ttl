		"In the United States, consumer loans do not include a home mortgage, small business, or small farm loans. They are defined by law to include the following: (1) Motor vehicle loan, which is a consumer loan extended for the purchase of and secured by a motor vehicle; (2) Credit card loan, which is a line of credit for household, family, or other personal expenditures that is accessed by a borrower's use of a 'credit card,' as this term is defined in ยง 1026.2 of 12 CFR ยง 228.12; (3) Other secured consumer loan, which is a secured consumer loan that is not included in one of the other categories of consumer loans; and (4) Other unsecured consumer loan, which is an unsecured consumer loan that is not included in one of the other categories of consumer loans."@en

		"Home equity loans allow the borrower to borrow against the difference between the fair market value of the property, as determined by an appraisal, and the amount of any outstanding debt on that property, which is typically a first mortgage. Common practice is to set the maximum amount that can be borrowed of up to 80 percent of the fair market value less any outstanding debt."@en ,
		"Usually, the term of a HELOC can vary from 5 to up to 25 years, with an initial draw period during which the borrower can access the line of credit, followed by a repayment period during which monthly payments on principal and interest are due until the loan is paid in full. Note that there are restrictions in the US on the nature of the property that may be used as collateral for a HELOC - it must be classified as a 1-4 family dwelling. That determination is independent from the use of proceeds."@en
