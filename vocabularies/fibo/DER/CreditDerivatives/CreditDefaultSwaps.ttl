	dcterms:abstract "Credit default swaps are financial instruments that allow the transfer of credit risk among market participants, potentially facilitating greater efficiency in the pricing and distribution/offset of credit risk. They are bilateral contracts in which one party (the protection seller) agrees to provide payment(s) to the other party (the protection buyer) should a credit event occur against the underlying. The underlier for a CDS may be a specified debt (the reference obligation), a specific debt issuer (reference entity), in which case the credit events involving the entity is what triggers the payment, a basket of reference entities and/or reference obligations, or a credit index (reference index). This ontology defines the concept of a basic credit default swap as well as more specific kinds of CDS and specifies related details." ;

They are financial instruments that allow the transfer of credit risk among market participants, potentially facilitating greater efficiency in the pricing and distribution of credit risk. In its most basic form, a CDS is a contract where a 'protection buyer' agrees to make periodic payments (the CDS 'spread' or premium) over a predetermined number of years (the maturity or term of the CDS) to a 'protection seller' in exchange for a payment from the protection seller in the event of default by a 'reference entity.' CDS premiums tend to be paid quarterly and are set as a percentage of the total amount of protection bought (the 'notional amount' of the contract). CDS maturities generally range from one to ten years, with the five-year maturity being particularly common.\" See https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022023pap.pdf for more detail."@en ,
